My name is Dusty. I was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1967. I like helping beginning students learn to fly. I only have 145 horse power but it’s a very smooth running engine. For years I had no name. My previous owner had a grandson  who decided that I should be called Dusty. Now that I’m living in New Mexico my name feels very appropriate.
